# Gatling - Configuration as Code

This skill provides guidance on how to generate or update the `.gatling/package.conf` package descriptor file for deploying tests to Gatling Enterprise.

## Instructions

1. Discover simulations based on the project language and build tool used: Java with Maven, JavaScript/TypeScript with the JavaScript CLI, Kotlin with Gradle, and Scala with sbt. 
   Collect their fully qualified class names (FQCN).

2. Read existing config: check if `.gatling/package.conf` already exists.
   For reference check `assets/package.conf` from this skill using the Read tool.

3. Before asking any questions, call all the proper MCP tools to get real data from the user's account:

    - Which teams are available.
    - Which managed and private locations are available.
    - Check if a package already exists for this project.
    - Check if a test (aka simulation) already exists for this project.

4. Ask the user what they need with the `AskUserQuestion` tool.
   If a list has >4 items, output the full list as markdown in a text message and ask the user to specify their choice(s) by name.

    - Which tests to include.
    - Package name (default to the project name, use artifactId if this is a Maven project).
    - Team name or ID, asks the users if they want to create a new team.
    - Load generator locations and weights, ask if they want to use a managed or private location.
    - Any system properties or environment variables.
    - Ramp up and ramp down time windows.
    - Stop criteria.

5. Generate or update the file following the structure and rules below.

## Key Rules

- `simulation` (FQCN) is the only mandatory field per simulation entry.
- Location `weight` values must sum to 100 across all locations for a simulation.
- System property names must be quoted (HOCON interprets dots as nested keys).
- Prefix system properties with `sensitive.` to hide values from the dashboard.
- Prefix environment variables with `SENSITIVE_` to hide values from the dashboard.
- The `default` block avoids repeating shared config; simulation-specific values override it.
- Maps (`systemProperties`, `environmentVariables`) are merged, with simulation values taking priority.
- `ignoreDefaults` refers to Gatling Enterprise's Default Load Generator Parameters, not the `default {}` block.
- After first deploy, IDs are logged — add them to `id` fields for consistent updates (allows renaming without creating duplicates).

## Locations

For managed locations, use the full name.
For private locations, use their ID.

## Stop criteria

```hocon
stopCriteria = [
  {
    type = "meanCpu"
    timeFrameInSeconds = 10
    threshold = { maxPercentage = 90 }
  },
  {
    type = "globalResponseTime"
    timeFrameInSeconds = 10
    threshold = { maxMilliseconds = 500, percentile = 95 }
  },
  {
    type = "globalErrorRatio"
    timeFrameInSeconds = 10
    threshold = { maxPercentage = 5 }
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP tool call fails

If any MCP tool call fails, check authentication first:

1. Verify `GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN` is set in the environment.
2. If missing, warn the user, suggest using `direnv`, and offer to create a `.envrc` file.
3. Never print the actual token value in the terminal or logs.
4. The token needs at least the **Configure** role on Gatling Enterprise.
