# Gatling Enterprise - Build Tools

## Instructions

### Step 1: Detect the build tool

Inspect the project root and identify the build tool by looking for these files, in this order:

- Maven: `pom.xml`
- JavaScript CLI: `package.json`
- Gradle: `build.gradle`, or `build.gradle.kts`
- sbt: `build.sbt`

### Step 2: Load build-tool-specific instructions

Once the build tool is identified, read the corresponding file and follow its instructions:

- Maven: ./references/maven-plugin.md
- JavaScript CLI: ./references/javascript-cli.md
- Gradle: ./references/gradle-plugin.md
- sbt: ./references/sbt-plugin.md

### Step 3: Common pre-flight checks

These checks apply regardless of build tools:

1. Verify `.gatling/package.conf` exists and is not empty.
   If missing or empty, help the user create it using the Configuration as Code skill.
2. Verify API token: check if `GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN` is set.
3. Verify tests referenced matches actual test classes in the source tree.

### Step 4: Build-tool-specific steps

Follow the instructions from the file loaded in Step 2 for:

1. Verifying the project compiles.
2. Running the deploy command.

### Step 5: Post-deploy

The output logs package and test IDs.
Suggest updating `.gatling/package.conf` with these IDs for consistent future deployments.

### Step 6: Starting a test

Ask the user if they want to start the test on Gatling Enterprise.
If so, follow the instructions from the file loaded in Step 2 for running the start command.

## Troubleshooting

### Build tool deploy/start or MCP tool call fails

If the build tool deploy/start or any MCP tool call fails, check authentication first:

1. Verify `GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN` is set in the environment.
2. If missing, warn the user, suggest using `direnv`, and offer to create a `.envrc` file.
3. Never print the actual token value in the terminal or logs.
4. The token needs at least the **Configure** role on Gatling Enterprise.
